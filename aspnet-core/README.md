#### Generating a Signing Certificate

In the production environment, you need to use a production signing certificate. ABP Framework sets up signing and encryption certificates in your application and expects an `openiddict.pfx` file in your application.

This certificate is already generated by ABP CLI, so most of the time you don't need to generate it yourself. However, if you need to generate a certificate, you can use the following command:

```bash
dotnet dev-certs https -v -ep openiddict.pfx -p f8922c37-58b8-4fea-b29f-196de8560bdb
```

> `f8922c37-58b8-4fea-b29f-196de8560bdb` is the password of the certificate, you can change it to any password you want.


#### Install Client-Side Libraries

Run the following command in the directory of your final application:

```bash
abp install-libs
```
